# MixerAudioOnly
a script for Tampermonkey to set streams on Mixer.com to audio only depending on the state of a cookie/checkbox

Also at https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/390520-mixer-audio-only

any other locations are not currently checked by me and may not have the same code that this does. always be wary of where you get your scripts from and what they do.
